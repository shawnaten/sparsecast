Error:

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:preDexProdDebug'.
> com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException:
Process 'command '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_66.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java''
finished with non-zero exit value 1

Solution:

This seems to have been fixed by switching from Java SDK 1.8 to 1.7

Now it's giving me the error for having too many classes which I don't understand because I thought
on Android >= 5.0 I didn't have to worry about this.
